Adjustable Flow Rate: 200 &ndash; 1575 gph.<br />3. Auto Shut-Off: Pump automatically shuts off if the propeller becomes jammed or if the 2 parts of the pump become separated.<br />4. Easy Installation: Bracket-less design with magnetic coupling is a snap to install.<br />5. Quick Cleanup: Wet-side cleaning is a breeze.<br />6. Upgradeable: Easily upgradeable to MP10W ES.<br />7. Peace of Mind: Optional Battery Backup keeps circulation going during a power failure for up to 72 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Wave Modes:</strong><br />1. EcoSmart Nutrient Transport Mode (NTM): Alternates between a resonant standing wave and a surge effect to stir up and export nutrients helping to promote coral growth and tank health.<br />2. EcoSmart Tidal Swell Mode (TSM): Simulates changing flow conditions of a natural tidal zone with a flow pattern that alternates from left to right, right to left, calm and then ending with a great surge.<br />3. Reef Crest Random Mode: Simulates high-energy conditions of a natural reef crest.<br />4. Lagoon Random Mode: Simulates low-energy conditions of a natural lagoon reef.<br />5. Constant Speed Mode: Runs at a constant speed set by the user based on the aquariums specific needs.<br />6. Short Pulse Mode: Allows for wave pulse timing between 0.3 and 2 seconds, enabling the creation of fast alternating flow throughout the tank.<br />7. Long Pulse Mode: Allows for wave pulse timing between 2 seconds and 60 seconds, enabling the creation of slow alternating flow throughout the tank.<br />8. Night Mode: Enables pump to operate for a 14 hour day period and a 10 hour night period.<br />9. Feed Mode: Slows down the pump(s) for 10 minutes to allow peaceful feeding.<br />10.

Flow Meter<br />- Water Outlet Assembly<br />- Air Silencer<br /><br /><strong>Product Highlights:</strong><br /><strong>1. Advanced Monitoring &amp; Control:</strong> To meet the needs of a wide variety of tanks sizes and bio-loads, the pumps water flow and thereby the skimmers performance can be controlled from 40-100% with a simple turn of a dial. The pumps controller also continually monitors skimmer performance and automatically stops and then re-starts the pump in the unlikely event of a problem.<br /><strong>2. Unmatched Performance:</strong> An improved air injection nozzle to increase air intake and an optimized pump housing to improve water flow combined with the innovative Grid-Wheel impeller produces an incredible amount of tiny, waste removing bubbles. The unique design of the skimmer body allows these bubbles to remain in contact with the water for a longer period of time, resulting in a skimmer that surpasses the performance of both larger and more expensive skimmers. The significantly higher surface area of the Grid-Wheel impeller easily outperforms traditional needle-wheel impellers producing an extremely dense and uniform air-water mixture.<br /><strong>3. Stable Performance:</strong> The Grid-Wheel impeller combines the stable performance of a needle-wheel with the superior performance of a thread or mesh-wheel impeller producing consistent, long-term performance. The integrated soft start ensures a safe and gentle start-up of the pump.<br /><strong>4. Energy Efficient:</strong> Uses less than 35 watts of energy while pulling in up to 3000 liters per hour of waste removing air.<br /><strong>5. Easy To Use:</strong> Built-in water-level adjustment valve allows for easy and precise fine-tuning of the skimmers performance. The water-level adjustment valve can also be rotated to change the position of the water outlet and many parts of the skimmer can be easily taken apart for cleaning.<br /><strong>6.
