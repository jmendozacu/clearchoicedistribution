An active cooling system allows bulbs to run at a more optimal temperature, improving both bulb output and bulb life.<br /><u>3. Plug &amp; Play:</u> With the built-in controller there is nothing more to buy.<br /><u>4. Clean, Contemporary Design:</u> The slim, silver colored body is lightweight, durable, rust-proof and just 2.1&rdquo; high. All components including the controller and T5 ballasts are built into the fixture housing with the only item external to the fixture being a single power-cord.<br /><u>5. Energy Efficient:</u> Produces up to 50% more light than most other equally sized T5 fixtures, without using more energy.<br /><u>6. Quiet, Cool Operation:</u> Runs cool and produces virtually no noise.<br /><br /><strong>Why T5&rsquo;s:</strong><br /><u>1. Tried and True Method:</u> T5&rsquo;s are a proven method for growing all types of coral including sps corals and clams.<br /><u>2. More Vibrant Colors:</u> Compared to other lighting options T5 bulbs come in a wide variety of unique color spectrums which offers greater flexibility and more options for enhancing each corals unique color. And with T5 bulbs costing about $20 each, it&rsquo;s inexpensive to &ldquo;play&rdquo; with different color combinations.<br /><u>3. Superior Light Balance:</u> T5's are a linear source of light, not a point source of light so corals don't have a particular point to grow towards.&nbsp;This produces&nbsp;corals that are typically&nbsp;much fuller than corals grown under point sources of light like metal halides or LED&rsquo;s.<br /><u>4. Save Money:</u> With a lower up-front cost than high-end metal halide and LED systems and the low cost of bulb replacements, a T5 system is typically cheaper to purchase and operate than a comparable metal halide set-up and typically on PAR with a comparable LED system.",,,,3,"48"" 8x54W Dimmable SunPower T5 High-Output Fixture w/ Controller by ATI","The ATI Dimmable SunPower T5 Fixture w/ Built-in Controller is the latest evolution in T5 technology adding full, integrated dimming control to the proven performance of the original SunPower.
