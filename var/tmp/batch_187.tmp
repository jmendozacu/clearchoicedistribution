The unique design of the skimmer body allows these bubbles to remain in contact with the water for a longer period of time, resulting in a skimmer that surpasses the performance of both larger and more expensive skimmers. The significantly higher surface area of the Grid-Wheel impeller easily outperforms traditional needle-wheel impellers producing an extremely dense and uniform air-water mixture.<br /><strong>3.
