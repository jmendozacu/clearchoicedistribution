Advanced Monitoring &amp; Control:</strong> To meet the needs of a wide variety of tanks sizes and bio-loads, the pumps water flow and thereby the skimmers performance can be controlled from 40-100% with a simple turn of a dial. The pumps controller also continually monitors skimmer performance and automatically stops and then re-starts the pump in the unlikely event of a problem.<br /><strong>2. Unmatched Performance:</strong> An improved air injection nozzle to increase air intake and an optimized pump housing to improve water flow combined with the innovative Grid-Wheel impeller produces an incredible amount of tiny, waste removing bubbles. The unique design of the skimmer body allows these bubbles to remain in contact with the water for a longer period of time, resulting in a skimmer that surpasses the performance of both larger and more expensive skimmers. The significantly higher surface area of the Grid-Wheel impeller easily outperforms traditional needle-wheel impellers producing an extremely dense and uniform air-water mixture.<br /><strong>3. Stable Performance:</strong> The Grid-Wheel impeller combines the stable performance of a needle-wheel with the superior performance of a thread or mesh-wheel impeller producing consistent, long-term performance. The integrated soft start ensures a safe and gentle start-up of the pump.<br /><strong>4. Energy Efficient:</strong> Uses less than 35 watts of energy while pulling in up to 3000 liters per hour of waste removing air.<br /><strong>5. Easy To Use:</strong> Built-in water-level adjustment valve allows for easy and precise fine-tuning of the skimmers performance. The water-level adjustment valve can also be rotated to change the position of the water outlet and many parts of the skimmer can be easily taken apart for cleaning.<br /><strong>6. Quiet Operation:</strong> Produces minimal noise due to innovative pump and skimmer body design and air silencer.<br /><strong>7. Excellent Build-Quality:</strong> Constructed of high-quality materials and assembled using modern production techniques.","Features a controllable pump and the innovative Grid-Wheel Impeller resulting in a skimmer with unsurpassed control and exceptional performance.","","","","","","","0.0000","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1.0000","1","0.0000","1","1","","","1","0","1","0","1","0.0000","1","0","0","0","1","PowerCone I-Series Protein Skimmer w/ Pump","0","grouped","","","","","","","","","","","","No layout updates"," ","No","","","","ATI","","","","","","","","","","","","1 Year Manufacturer's Limited Warranty","","","Enabled","No","","","","","","","","","","","",""
